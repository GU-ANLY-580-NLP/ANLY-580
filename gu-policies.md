# Georgetown University Policies

### Georgetown University’s Plagiarism Policy 
Plagiarism or academic dishonesty in any form will not be tolerated and may result in a failing grade. All Honor Code violations will be submitted to the Honor Council. 
Academic integrity is central to the learning and teaching process. Students are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that will contribute to the maintenance of academic integrity by making all reasonable efforts to prevent the occurrence of academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty includes (but is not limited to) obtaining or giving aid on an examination, having unauthorized prior knowledge of an examination, doing work for another student, and plagiarism of all types, including copying code. 
Plagiarism is the intentional or unintentional presentation of another person’s idea or product as one’s own. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to the following: copying verbatim all or part of another’s written work; using phrases, charts, figures, illustrations, code, or mathematical/scientific solutions without citing the source; paraphrasing ideas, conclusions, or research without citing the source; and using all or part of a literary plot, poem, film, musical score, or other artistic product without attributing the work to its creator. Students can avoid unintentional plagiarism by following carefully accepted scholarly practices. Notes taken for papers and research projects should accurately record sources cited, quoted, paraphrased, or summarized sources and articles should be acknowledged in footnotes.

### Honor System
All students are expected to maintain the highest standards of academic and personal integrity in pursuit of their education at Georgetown. Academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, in any form, is a serious offense, and students found in violation are subject to academic penalties that include, but are not limited to, failure of the course, termination from the program, and revocation of degrees already conferred. All students are held to the Georgetown University Honor Code. For more information about the Honor Code (http://gervaseprograms.georgetown.edu/honor/)

### Academic Integrity and Courtesy 
As a Jesuit, Catholic university committed to the education of the whole person, Georgetown expects all members of the academic community, students and faculty, to strive for excellence in scholarship and in character. The University spells out the specific minimum standards for academic integrity in its Honor Code and the procedures to be followed if academic dishonesty is suspected. Over and above the honor code, in this course, we will seek to create an engaged and passionate learning environment characterized by respect and courtesy in both our discourse and our ways of paying attention to one another.

### Academic Resource Center
The Academic Resource Center (ARC) is the campus office responsible for reviewing medical documentation and determining reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities.

### Counseling and Psychiatric Services (CAPS)
As Georgetown faculty, you are among the most important individuals in some of the students’ lives. They may turn to you when they are struggling and in times of need, or you may be one of the first to notice when they are distressed. The CAPS website has tips for faculty on how to deal with struggling or distressed students. 
202.687.6985 or after hours, call (833) 960-3006 to reach Fonemed, a telehealth service; individuals may ask for the on-call CAPS clinician.

### Emergency Preparedness and HOYAlert
We encourage all faculty to become familiar with Georgetown’s Office of Emergency Management and sign up for HOYAlert to receive important safety and University operating status updates. Faculty teaching at the Georgetown Downtown campus might also want to sign up for AlertDC to obtain safety and traffic updates.

### Office of Institutional Compliance and Ethics
The Office of Institutional Compliance and Ethics supports and coordinates many compliance-related activities the University undertakes. With the endorsement and assistance of the University’s senior leadership, this Office is responsible for leading the development, implementation, and operation of the Georgetown Institutional Compliance and Ethics Program.

### Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action (IDEAA)
The mission of IDEAA is to promote a deep understanding and appreciation among the diverse members of the University community to result in justice and equality in educational, employment, and contracting opportunities, as well as to lead efforts to create an inclusive academic and work environment.

### Title IX/Sexual Misconduct 
Georgetown University and its faculty are committed to supporting survivors and those impacted by sexual misconduct, which includes sexual assault, sexual harassment, relationship violence, and stalking. Georgetown requires faculty members unless otherwise designated as confidential, to report all disclosures of sexual misconduct to the University Title IX Coordinator or a Deputy Title IX Coordinator. Suppose you disclose an incident of sexual misconduct to a professor in or outside of the classroom (except disclosures in papers). In that case, that faculty member must report the incident to the Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Title IX Coordinator. The coordinator will, in turn, reach out to the student to provide support, resources, and the option to meet—[Please note that the student is not required to meet with the Title IX coordinator.]. More information about reporting options and resources can be found on the Sexual Misconduct Website (https://sexualassault.georgetown.edu/resourcecenter). 
If you would prefer to speak to someone confidentially, Georgetown has a number of fully confidential professional resources that can provide support and assistance. These resources include:
Health Education Services for Sexual Assault Response and Prevention: confidential email sarp@georgetown.edu
Counseling and Psychiatric Services (CAPS): 202.687.6985 or after hours, call (833) 960-3006 to reach Fonemed, a telehealth service; individuals may ask for the on-call CAPS clinician. More information about reporting options and resources can be found on the Sexual Misconduct Website.

### Title IX Sexual Misconduct Statement
Please know that as a faculty member, I am committed to supporting survivors of sexual misconduct, including relationship violence and sexual assault. However, university policy also requires me to report any disclosures about sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator, whose role is to coordinate the University’s response to sexual misconduct.

Georgetown has a number of fully confidential professional resources who can provide support and assistance to survivors of sexual assault and other forms of sexual misconduct. These resources include:
